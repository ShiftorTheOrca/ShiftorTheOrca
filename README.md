## Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leonardo Sanjaya. 

I am a student in Universitas of Surabaya, and I am learning informatics engineering focusing in data science and artificial intelligence. 

I am currently enrolled in Asah led by Dicoding Indonesia as a cohort of the machine learning division. 

I've learnt C#, Java, and Python programming language, and a little bit of JavaScript and PHP. I am looking forward to expand my knowledge on other programming languages and computer in general.
